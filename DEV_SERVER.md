# Running the dev server

This is **maury-net** ([github.com/stephen329/maury-net](https://github.com/stephen329/maury-net)).

To run the correct project:

1. **Open a terminal in this folder** (`maury-net`), not in `cnc-web-fe` or another project.
2. From this folder run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:3000 — you should see **Maury.net | Three Generations of Nantucket Real Estate** (check the browser tab title).

If you still see a different site (e.g. Congdon and Coleman), stop the dev server (Ctrl+C), confirm your terminal’s current directory is `maury-net`, then run `npm run dev` again.
